# LoopBack SDK Builder

**NOTE: The loopback-sdk-builder module supersedes [loopback-sdk-angular](https://www.npmjs.org/loopback-sdk-angular). Please update your package.json accordingly.**

The LoopBack SDK Builder is a fork of the official `loopback-sdk-angular` extended by the community and maintained by [Jonathan Casarrubias](http://twitter.com/johncasarrubias)

The client is dynamic, in other words it automatically includes all the
LoopBack models and methods you've defined on your server.
You don't have to manually write any static code.

See the official [LoopBack AngularJS SDK
documentation](http://docs.strongloop.com/display/LB/AngularJS+JavaScript+SDK)
for more information.
